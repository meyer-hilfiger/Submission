File comparing the experimental Fourier coefficients distribution in corrected RLPN to the Fourier coefficients distribution under Poisson Model (Assumption 5.5 in the paper) or under the LPN model (Problem 1.2).
Files are in the format : experiment_vs_poisson_w_s_k_n_u_t_NMAX.pdf

Where the number N of LPN samples in each iteration is the biggest integer N such that N <= NMAX and such that there exists at least N parity-checks of weight w.
